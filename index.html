	<p class="section1text">I'm death machi... Ughm, sorry. I am Mikhail Kovalev, a student, an athlete and just a wonderful simulacrum, sorry again, man. I live in the most beautiful city of St. Petersburg, but I come from the equally lovely city of Samara. My hobby is, of course, killi..., oh, that is, video games. I also love cooking, reading books, walking, everything that ordinary human beings love.</p>

			<div class="div1"><h3>3D Modeling</h3>
				
	<p class="section2text"> Since high school, I have been interested in 3D, and my skills in this field are growing every day. I really believe that at least for some time in my life I will work in the field of level design and art design, because this fascinates and interests me probably the most.</p> <img src="img/blender_logo.png" alt="blender" style="width: 65%;"></div>
			<div class="div2"><h3>Graphic Design</h3>
	<p class="section2text"> Unlike 3d, I got acquainted with graphic design already at university, but this area may have interested me no less. I am so much interested in freelancing in this sphere, and a couple of projects have already been done. </p>  <img src="img/AI.png" alt="ai" style="width: 25%; margin: 20px;">  <img src="img/ps.jpg" alt="ps" style="width: 25%;margin: 20px;"></div>
			<div class="div3"><h3>Web-Design</h3>
	<p class="section2text">I really really hope that web design is a skill that I possess. It's not that I can't do anything in this area, on the contrary, I'm quite passionate about working at Adobe Dreamweaver and Figma, but I also think I could devote more time to developing this skill and some others</p><img src="img/dw.png" alt="dw" style="width: 25%; margin: 20px;">  <img src="img/figma.png" alt="figma" style="width: 25%;margin: 20px;"></div>

	<div id="Exp" class="section3"><h1>Experience</h1>
	<p class="section3text">Since I didn't know what to write in this section, I'll describe my experience with Adobe Animate. Only a woman giving birth can roughly understand the pain experienced by a student working at Adobe Animate. But seriously, from the first task, it was not very clear why we use this program, because its functionality is the same as, for example, Adobe After Effects, but a little more inconvenient. Sometimes it seemed that it would be more convenient to draw each frame by hand than to work in this program. Of course, I found it a little interesting to work with the forms and symbols in tasks 3, 4 and 5, but it seems to me that it was just the Stockholm syndrome that began to manifest itself. While working on task 6, I made sure that it was Stockholm syndrome. Only by catching strong inspiration you can work with this wonderful program. But it seems that by the 8th task it turned out to cope with this chimera at least a little</p>
